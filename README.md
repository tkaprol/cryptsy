PHP Class for Cryptsy.com. 

How Do I Use It?
=======

You can simply copy class under your project and replace API key and secret with yours. If you do not have any Cryptsy.com account yet, you may use following url to register;

https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=281121

**Warning!** Cryptsy API allows your account balance visible, so I do not recommend to use an active accounts API key in a website. Please create an additional account for API.

Check test.php for advanced examples.
